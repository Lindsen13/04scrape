# 04Scrape

It's not a secret - as a kid I was completely occupied about Runescape! Recently, the [Lost City](https://github.com/2004Scape/Server) project enables geeks like me to experience this feeling again from 2004.

This little project tries to use DuckDB, DBT and Streamlit to get some insights into the development of the top players on this game. Who will be the first player to max at a total level of 1782?

[Check](https://04scrape-jsbndpknzqumxj69s56rapp.streamlit.app/) it out yourself!
